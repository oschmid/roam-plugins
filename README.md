# Roam Research Plugins

### Clear Sidebar Plugin

Adds a button to the right sidebar to clear all open blocks/pages. Handy when you have a lot open in the sidebar and want to move on to a new task.

Also adds a keyboard shortcut (Alt/Opt + C) to clear all blocks/pages from sidebar.

### Left Expander Plugin

Moved to Roam Depot. Source [here](https://github.com/oschmid/roam-left-expander/)

### Random Page Plugin

Adds a button to the left sidebar to go to a randomly chosen note. Handy for finding old pages to cleanup, reminding yourself of old ideas, and connecting those old ideas to those you're thinking of right now.

Also adds a keyboard shortcut (Alt/Opt + R) to go to a random note and (Alt/Opt + Shift + R) to open a random note in the right sidebar.

When used on the 'All Pages' page, use the search filter to chose from only a subset of pages.

## Installation
